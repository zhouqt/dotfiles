This is my own todotxt plugin directory, it contains:

**continue**:
    remove WAIT tag from a todo item

**wait**:
    add a WAIT tag to an item, followed by current date

**do**:
    like built-in "do", but also handles ticklers from "remind"

**show**:
    display prioritized and colorized todo items, together with "remind" tickers and goals
